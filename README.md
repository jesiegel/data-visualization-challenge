# data-visualization-challenge

In this challenge, I was given two datasets, mouse_metadata and Study_results. The goal was to complete the following:
- Prepare the data.
- Generate summary statistics.
- Create bar charts and pie charts.
- Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot.
- Create a line plot and a scatter plot.
- Calculate correlation and regression.
- Submit your final analysis.

Through this process, I wanted to examine which drug is most effective in treating squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).
